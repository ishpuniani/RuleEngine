# RuleEngine

For input: 
Replace Paths in code

Rules.txt takes input in the following format:-
SIGNAL~OPERATOR~VALUE

Performance:
Time taken to process std input = 177ms

If i had more time, i would improve the Rule to rule mappings algorithm.
Maybe even implement some other algorithm while reading the input stream.
